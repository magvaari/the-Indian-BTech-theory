## Object-Oriented Analysis
During object-oriented analysis, there is an emphasis on finding and describing the objects—or concepts—in the problem domain.  
For example, in the case of the library information system, some of the concepts include Book, Library, and Patron. 
  
## Object-Oriented Design
During object-oriented design, there is an emphasis on defining software objects and how they collaborate to fulfill the requirements.   
For example, in the library system, a Book software object may have a title attribute and a getChapter method.

## The UML :: The Unified Modeling Language 
A language for specifying, visualizing, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of software systems, business modeling and other non-software systems 
 
### UML History 
The UML was adopted as the standard diagramming notation for object-oriented modeling in 1997 by the OMG - Object Modelling Group.

## The UP :: The Unified Process
It combines commonly accepted best practices, such as an iterative lifecycle and risk-driven development, into a cohesive and well-documented description.  
 
### Unified Process Phases
1. **Inception**
    — A kind of feasibility phase, where just enough investigation is done to support a decision to continue or stop. Keywords: approximate vision, business case, scope, vague estimates. 
2. **Elaboration**
    — A phase which involves refined vision, iterative implementation of the core architecture, resolution/mitigation  of high risks, identification of most requirements and scope, more realistic estimates. 
3. **Construction**
    — iterative implementation of the remaining lower risk and easier elements, and preparation for deployment. 
4. **Transition**
    — beta tests, deployment.
