# Case Study :: The NextGen POS System
**The NextGen point-of-sale (POS) system** is a computerized application used (in part) to record sales and handle payments in a retail store (typically). It includes:

#### Hardware components
- computer
- bar code scannner

#### Software Components
- required to run the system
- interfaces to various service applications
    - such as a third-party tax calculator and inventory control. 
- interfaces to client-side terminals and interfaces.
    - a thin-client Web browser terminal, 
    - a regular personal computer with something like a Java Swing graphical user interface, 
    - touch screen input, 
    - wireless PDAs, and et cetera.
    
#### Commercial factors
- must be relatively fault-tolerant. 
    - It means the main task should not be affected by ill functioning of its extraneous components.
    - Example, if inventory system is temporary unavailable, it should not affect the capturing of sales and handling of basic payment method like cash. So, that business remains safe.
- mechanism to provide flexibility and customization to clients
    - Each client has different requirements and hence need unique set of logic to execute at certain predictable points.
    - Example, new sale initiates or new line item is added.
